### Problem 1 :- Reverse the array (Without Using Extra Space)

1. You are given an array, such that you have to reverse the array
2. Please note that you have to reverse the given array, and using a new array should be avoided.
3. Also, refrain from printing the elements directly.

### Problem 2 :- Equilibrium Element
Given an array A of N positive numbers. The task is to find the position
where equilibrium first occurs in the array. An equilibrium position in
an array is a position such that the sum of elements before it is equal to the sum of elements after it. The valid index range is from [ 1, n-2 ] because there should be at least one element on both sides.

### Problem 3 :- Element in the middle
Given an unsorted array of size, N. Find the first element in the array such that
all of its left elements are smaller and all right elements to it are greater than it.
Note: Left and right side elements can be equal to the required element. 
And extreme elements cannot be required element.

### Problem 4 :- Jumping on the clouds
There is a new mobile game that starts with consecutively numbered clouds. Some of the clouds are thunderheads and others are cumulus. The player can jump on any cumulus cloud having a number that is equ
al to the number of the current cloud plus 1 or 2. The player must avoid
the thunderheads. Determine the minimum number of jumps it will take
to jump from the starting postion to the last cloud. It is always possible to win the game.
For each game, you will get an array of clouds numbered 0 if they are safe or 1 if they must be avoided.

### Problem 5 :- Container with most water
You are given an integer array height of length n . There are n vertical
lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and(i, height[i]) .
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, 
such that the container contains the most water.
Note: that you may not slant the container.

### Problem 6 :- Man of the Match
Team RCB has successfully chased a total and finally won their first match in the IPL after a string of losses. Interestingly, the openers managed it comfortably and no wicket fell during their innings in this match.
The openers Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers played a total of n overs to chase their target. You are presented with an array of size 6 (because
1 over is equal to 6 balls) which consists of the runs scored in that particular ball.
You know that AB de Villiers took the strike initially and played the firstball
1. You have to find out who scored more runs during the match after n Overs to decide the Man of the Match.
Print "Virat Kohli" if Virat scored more, else "AB de Villiers". Print "Tie" incase when both scored equal runs.
Note-
The array consist of values {0,1,2,3,4,6}. There are no extras.
The strike rotates after every 6 balls or if 1 or 3 run is taken.

### Problem 7 :- Rick n Richards
There is a contest of Competitive eating. Rick and Richard were participating in the game.
N bananas are placed in a line. Rick starts to eat from left to right, and
Richard from right to left. For each banana, its length is known.
Rick eats with speed twice that of Richard. If a player starts to eat the
banana, other player can't touch it. If both players reach the same banana simultaneously, Rick gets to eat that banana as he snatches it away from Richard.
How many bananas each of the players will eat?

### Problem 8 :- Contractor
A Contractor's daily tasks involve noting the number of hours the labour works and paying them accordingly.
But at one time you only require one labour, so as he finishes his job you give the job to the next labour.
If there are no labours available you wait until the next labour comes.
If labour comes when another one is already doing some task, he waits
until the job is finished and then asks the contractor for a job.
The contractor has the time labours came to the site, and the time the I abours left.
He asks you to find the number of hours each labour works.
Refer to the I/O for better understanding.

### Problem 9 :- Mark and toys
Mark and Jane are very happy after having their first child. Their son loves toys, so Mark wants to buy some. There are a number of different toys lying in front of him, tagged with their prices. Mark has only a certa
in amount to spend, and he wants to maximize the number of toys he buys with this money. Given a list of toy prices and an amount to spend, determine the maximum number of gifts he can buy.
Note: Each toy can be purchased only once.

### Problem 10 :- Hardware problem
Ansh turned on a computer at time 0 and clicked the mouse N times.
The i-th (1≤i≤N) click was at time T[i] . Here T represents the array of
times, i.e, when the mouse of clicked.
If he consecutively clicked the mouse at time x1 and time ×2 (where ×1<x2), a double click is said to be fired at time x2 if and only if x2 -×1 ≤ D.
What time was a double click fired for the first time? If no double click
was fired, print -1 instead.
